# windows-image-downloader
An open-source app fully in python that allows users to download .iso files from windows xp to windows 11. My script uses some safe sites to provide you with your windows downloads. If you're curious about the code you can check the windows_images.py in the source code. You can find the exe file in the releases tab. Hope you enjoy <3
